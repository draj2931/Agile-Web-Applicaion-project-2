                      Agile methodology is a type of project management process, mainly used for software development,
                      where demands and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and
                      cross-functional teams and their customers.<br>


                      Agile is a project management approach developed as a more flexible and efficient way to get
                      products to market. The word ‘agile’ refers to the ability to move quickly and easily. Therefore,
                      an
                      Agile approach enables project teams to adapt faster and easier compared to other project
                      methodologies.

                      Many of today’s projects have more unknowns than a traditional project management methodology can
                      adequately handle. This uncertainty makes it challenging to document requirements and adapt to
                      changes successfully.
                      This guide will explain the Agile methodology, which projects will benefit from an Agile approach,
                      and how to implement one effectively.You can run an Agile project using several different
                      frameworks. Some of the more popular ones include:

                    <ul class="agile-list;font-weight-bold">
                      <li>Scrum</li>
                      <li>Kanban</li>
                      <li>Extreme Programming</li>
                      <li>DSDM</li>
                    </ul>

                  <p class="card-text">
                  <div class="col-8">
                    In the 1990s, software development faced a bit of a crisis. Referred to as ‘the application
                    development crisis’ or ‘application delivery lag’, the industry realized that it couldn’t move fast
                    enough to meet customer demands and requirements—the estimated time between a business need and
                    actual application was about three years.<br>
                    See, traditional development models were based on a
                    timeline approach, where development happened sequentially and the final product wasn’t revealed to
                    customers until the very final step.
                    <br>
                    This left little room for flexibility when it came to progress
                    reviews and changes. So, by the time an actual application was finished, it was highly likely that
                    requirements and systems of the project’s original objectives had changed.

                    With time, money, and efforts wasted, and even some projects cancelled halfway through, professional
                    leaders of the software community thought it was time for a new, refreshed approach.
                    <br>
                    Then in 2001,
                    in a snowy, ski lodge in Utah, a group of industry practitioners gathered to discuss industry
                    practices. Though the meeting was set up with a primary focus on the discussion of development
                    cycles, some participants were already entertaining the idea of a new software development method.
                    They all yearned to cement a process that legitimized what was being practised, and so, came the
                    creation of the Agile Manifesto.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">
                      <li>Agile methodology project management and Waterfall project management are two of the more
                        popular methods for organizing projects. When determining how to plan and run your next project,
                        you’ll likely start by comparing Agile and Waterfall project management to determine which is
                        more
                        suitable.

                      </li>
                      <li> Waterfall is a more traditional approach to project management, involving a linear project
                        flow. It’s best for clearly defined projects with definitive timelines and well-defined
                        deliverables from the outset. In other words, if your major project constraints are well
                        understood and documented, Waterfall is likely your best option. </li>

                      <li>Core principles of Waterfall:
                        <ol class="agile-list1" style="list-style-type:lower-roman; text-align: justify;">
                          <b>
                            <li>Gathering all requirements upfront</li>
                            <li> Completing all work in structured, sequential, pre-defined phases </li>
                        </ol>
                      </li>
                      </b>
                      <li>Conversely, Agile was created to handle projects where the primary constraints are not well
                        understood.</li>
                      <li>As discussed earlier, Agile is an iterative, flexible approach to projects. This method splits
                        a
                        project into stages or “sprints,” allowing it to mature and evolve as you gain more information.
                      </li>

                      <li>When deciding between Waterfall project management and Agile, it should ultimately come down
                        to
                        your end product’s maturity and how well you understand the project’s outcomes and requirements
                        in
                        the initiation phase.</li>
